CAT806-landscape
================

It's getting cold, I needed something to keep myself warm this evening and since I have Flash turned off I thought WebGL would do the trick.

See it running here: http://revdancatt.github.com/CAT806-landscape/

You will need a WebGL enabled browser.

TO-DO:

1) Shed load of optimisation and cheating to make it run smoother.
2) A sky, because that may be nice.
